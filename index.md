Abstract:
> Mobility has become a basic premise of network communications, thereby
> requiring a native integration into 5G networks. Despite numerous efforts to
> propose and standardize effective mobility-management models for IP, the
> result is a complex, poorly flexible set of mechanisms.
> The natural support for mobility offered by ICN (Information Centric
> Networking) makes it a good candidate to define a radically new solution
> relieving limitations of the traditional approaches. If consumer mobility is
> supported in ICN by design, in virtue of its connectionless pull-based
> communication model, producer mobility is still an open challenge.
> In this work, we look at two prominent ICN architecture, CCN (Content Centric
> Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) and we propose MAP-Me, an
> anchor-less solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers via a name-
> based CCN/NDN data plane, with support for latency-sensitive streaming
> applications. We analyze MAP-Me performance and provide guarantees of
> correctness, stability, and bounded stretch, which we verify on real ISP
> topologies. Finally, we set up a comprehensive simulation environment in
> NDNSim 2.1 for MAP-Me evaluation and comparison with different classes of
> solution. We cover a wide range of topologies, mobility models and radio
> conditions, and conclude with a realistic trace-driven car-mobility pattern
> under a 802.11n radio access. The results are encouraging and highlight MAP-Me
> characteristics and efficiency in terms of user performance and network cost
> metrics. All the code is available as open-source.
